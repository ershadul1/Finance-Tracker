# Finance-Tracker


## Project Description

This is an app which tracks finance. Users can create transactions and groups. The transaction can have groups. Also a transaction can be a earning transaction or a spending transaction. That means users can track their earning and spending at the same time. 

Users can see their total earning and spending. And also a balance is calculated using earning and spending. So this app will help a user to record their total finance.

Users can upload profile images and group images. Also users can delete or update the transactions, groups and images.
